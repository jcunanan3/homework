    "We have gone through the above website and pulled out a variety of different datasets that we think are particularly interesting. Some of the datasets are from external sources as well, but all are related to San Francisco. A high level overview of data folders is provided after the project requirements section.\n",

    "** Feel free to include any other datasets from the San Francisco data if you think there is relevance or if it could be useful for your analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The uncompressed data is a large filesize.** Even the compressed data is pretty large. The data is compressed into a .7z format which has one of the smallest filesizes available. You will likely need a 3rd party app to extract it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Utilities for .7z\n",
    "- For OSX [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/en/) or [The Unarchiver](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html). \n",
    "- For Windows [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) is the standard. \n",
    "- For Linux try the `p7zip` utility.  `sudo apt-get install p7zip`.\n",

    "**Models must be regression. This means that your target variable needs to be numeric/continuous**\n",
